<h3>Experimental GA, P, PI tunning in switching systems (power converters)</h3>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
Experimental method of tunning P, PI regulator using genetic programming in raw form without librares.
It's main purpose is to verify how genetic programming method can solve stochastic problem of tunning regulator
in switching systems like Buck or Boost converters. Method is based on state space eq. of Buck converter circuit.
